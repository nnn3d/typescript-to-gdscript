   * The maximum number of frames that can be rendered every second (FPS). A value of `0` means the framerate is uncapped.
   * Limiting the FPS can be useful to reduce the host machine's power consumption, which reduces heat, noise emissions, and improves battery life.
   * If {@link ProjectSettings.display/window/vsync/vsync_mode} is **Enabled** or **Adaptive**, the setting takes precedence and the max FPS number cannot exceed the monitor's refresh rate. See also {@link DisplayServer.screen_get_refresh_rate}.
   * If {@link ProjectSettings.display/window/vsync/vsync_mode} is **Enabled**, on monitors with variable refresh rate enabled (G-Sync/FreeSync), using an FPS limit a few frames lower than the monitor's refresh rate will reduce input lag while avoiding tearing (https://blurbusters.com/howto-low-lag-vsync-on/). At higher refresh rates, the difference between the FPS limit and the monitor refresh rate should be increased to ensure frames to account for timing inaccuracies. The optimal formula for the FPS limit value in this scenario is `r - (r * r) / 3600.0`, where `r` is the monitor's refresh rate.
   * **Note:** The actual number of frames per second may still be below this value if the CPU or GPU cannot keep up with the project's logic and rendering.
   * **Note:** If {@link ProjectSettings.display/window/vsync/vsync_mode} is **Disabled**, limiting the FPS to a high value that can be consistently reached on the system can reduce input lag compared to an uncapped framerate. Since this works by ensuring the GPU load is lower than 100%, this latency reduction is only effective in GPU-bottlenecked scenarios, not CPU-bottlenecked scenarios.

   * CPU usage scales approximately with the physics tick rate. However, at very low tick rates (usually below 30), physics behavior can break down. Input can also become less responsive at low tick rates as there can be a gap between input being registered, and the response on the next physics tick. High tick rates give more accurate physics simulation, particularly for fast moving objects. For example, racing games may benefit from increasing the tick rate above the default 60.
   * See also {@link max_fps} and {@link ProjectSettings.physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second}.
   * **Note:** Only {@link max_physics_steps_per_frame} physics ticks may be simulated per rendered frame at most. If more physics ticks have to be simulated per rendered frame to keep up with rendering, the project will appear to slow down (even if `delta` is used consistently in physics calculations). Therefore, it is recommended to also increase {@link max_physics_steps_per_frame} if increasing {@link physics_ticks_per_second} significantly above its default value.
   * **Note:** Consider enabling physics interpolation ($DOCS_URL/tutorials/physics/interpolation/index.html) if you change {@link physics_ticks_per_second} to a value that is not a multiple of `60`.
